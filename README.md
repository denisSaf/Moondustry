# Moondustry
An interesting mod that adds a lot of new materials and diversifies the standard game <br />
My first practice of creating mods in Java. 

## Download
You can download the latest **stable** version from the "Releases" section. <br/>But, it is also possible to install modifications using the browser directly in the game itself. Just type "Moondustry" into the search. <br /> 
To install unreleased versions, go to the [Actions](https://github.com/iMainDay/Moondustry/actions) tab and install the latest version marked with a green check mark. (this installation method is not recommended for regular users, as the versions from this tab may be unstable and contain a lot of errors) <br />
